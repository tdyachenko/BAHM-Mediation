	- select a mirror/location and download and install R software
	- you can also install R and RStudio (which provide some convenience) from one place:

2. Open file called LinesToLoad_BAHM.R

3. Follow the instructions in the file (3 lines)

The app can also be run as a web application, but it can be slower with some bugs.
